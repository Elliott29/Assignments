### Understanding Automation:

**Group Research:**
1. **Divide into Subgroups:**
   - Allocate topics among subgroups, such as automation tools, benefits of automation, and real-world automation use cases.
   
2. **Research and Discussion:**
   - Each subgroup conducts detailed research on their assigned topic. Use credible sources like academic journals, technical blogs, and industry reports.
   - Discuss findings within the subgroup, ensuring everyone understands the key concepts.
   
3. **Share and Compile Insights:**
   - Reconvene with the larger team to share each subgroup's insights.
   - Compile a collective document or presentation summarizing the discussed automation concepts.

**CI/CD Exploration:**
1. **Joint Learning Session:**
   - Organize a session to discuss the principles of CI/CD. Include topics like version control, automated testing, and deployment strategies.
   
2. **Discuss Improvements:**
   - Highlight how CI/CD can improve development efficiency and maintain code quality by reducing manual errors and integrating code changes more frequently.

### GitHub Actions:

**Group Experimentation:**
1. **Explore GitHub Actions:**
   - Have each team member go through the [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to understand its features and capabilities.

2. **Knowledge Sharing:**
   - Set up a meeting where each member shares an interesting find about GitHub Actions.

**Workflow Setup:**
1. **Hands-On Setup:**
   - Work together to create a basic CI/CD pipeline for a simple project.
   - Customize the pipeline to meet your project's needs, such as deploying a website or testing code after pushes to the repository.

### Continuous Integration (CI):

**Test Automation:**
1. **Design Automated Tests:**
   - Design unit tests and integration tests that are triggered with each code push.
   - Discuss the importance of code coverage and review tools to maintain code quality.

**Pipeline Optimization:**
1. **Enhance Pipeline Performance:**
   - Experiment with features like caching dependencies or running jobs in parallel to improve pipeline performance.

### Documentation and Sharing:

**Team Documentation:**
1. **Document Findings:**
   - Create a shared document where all members contribute insights, examples, and explanations of CI/CD and GitHub Actions.

**Community Engagement:**
1. **Prepare Presentations:**
   - Develop presentations or blog posts summarizing your findings.
   - Use platforms like Medium, GitHub Pages, or internal company wikis to share your work.

**Feedback and Assistance:**
- Always be open to asking for help or feedback from peers or instructors.
- Use tools like Slack, Teams, or in-person meetings to facilitate ongoing communication.

### Conclusion:

After completing these tasks, your team will have a strong understanding of automation and CI/CD practices. The documentation and shared learning will not only benefit your team but also contribute to the collective knowledge of the Pero's Academy community.
