# Professional Profile Assignment

Welcome to the Professional Profile Assignment! This folder contains the assignments for creating professional profiles as part of the Pero's Academy curriculum. Each apprentice is tasked with creating their own professional profile to showcase their skills, experiences, and achievements.

## Assignment Details

### Objective
The objective of this assignment is to provide apprentices with the opportunity to develop a professional online presence that effectively communicates their skills, experiences, and achievements. By creating a professional profile, apprentices will enhance their digital identity and establish themselves as capable professionals in their field.

### Instructions
1. **Profile Content:** 
   - Each apprentice must create a professional profile file named `YourName_Profile.md` (for Markdown) or `YourName_Profile.html` (for HTML).
   - The profile should include essential elements such as the apprentice's name, position/title, introduction, projects worked on, achievements, and contact information. Apprentices are encouraged to personalize their profiles to reflect their unique strengths and experiences.
   
2. **Location:**
   - The profile files should be stored in this folder (`your_github.io_professional_site_assignment`) within the Pero's Academy Assignments repository. This central location ensures easy access for instructors and fellow apprentices to review and provide feedback on the profiles.
