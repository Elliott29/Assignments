## Naming Conventions

In order to maintain a clean and organized repository, we adhere to specific naming conventions for all files and folders. These conventions facilitate easy navigation, understanding, and collaboration within our projects. Please follow these guidelines when contributing to the repository:

### General Rules

- **Use Lowercase:** Always use lowercase letters. Avoid uppercase letters to prevent case sensitivity issues across different operating systems.
- **Use Hyphens for Spaces:** Use hyphens (`-`) instead of spaces in file and folder names. This improves readability and avoids issues with spaces in URLs and command lines.
- **Be Descriptive:** Choose names that clearly reflect the file or folder's content or purpose. Avoid vague descriptors.

### For Folders

- **Project Names:** Start with the project name, followed by a descriptive identifier if necessary. Example: `quantum-computing-experiments`.
- **Categorization:** Group related files into directories that describe their purpose. Example: `docs`, `src`, `tests`.

### For Files

- **Include Context:** File names should include context or categorization, especially for projects with multiple components. Example: `installation-guide.md`.
- **Date Format (if applicable):** For files that are date-sensitive, such as meeting notes or project plans, use the format `YYYY-MM-DD` at the beginning of the file name. Example: `2024-02-17-meeting-notes.md`.
- **Extensions:** Use appropriate file extensions that reflect the file type. Example: `.py` for Python scripts, `.md` for Markdown documents.

### Special Files

- **README:** Every project should contain a `README.md` file at its root, providing an overview of the project.
- **CONTRIBUTING:** The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, typically at the root, should outline guidelines for contributing to the project, including these naming conventions.

### Examples

- Correct: `cybersecurity-threat-analysis.md`, `data-visualization-tool/src/main.py`
- Incorrect: `CyberSecurity Threat Analysis.MD`, `Data Visualization Tool\Src\Main.PY`

By following these naming conventions, we ensure that our repository remains organized and accessible for all contributors. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding these guidelines, please feel free to raise an issue in the repository.
