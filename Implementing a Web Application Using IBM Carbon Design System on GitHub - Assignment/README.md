### Assignment Title: Implementing a Web Application Using IBM Carbon Design System on GitHub

#### Overview:
For this assignment, you are tasked with creating a fully functional web application that utilizes the IBM Carbon Design System, hosted within your own GitHub repository. This project aims to provide hands-on experience with one of the most robust design systems, focusing on accessibility, usability, and efficient design-to-code workflows. By the end of this assignment, you should have a deeper understanding of how to integrate and customize design systems in web development projects.

#### Objectives:
- Understand the principles and components of the IBM Carbon Design System.
- Learn to set up and manage a project repository on GitHub.
- Gain practical experience in implementing UI elements according to a design system.
- Enhance skills in web development, focusing on accessibility and responsive design.

#### Requirements:
1. **GitHub Repository Setup:**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub for your web application.
   - Ensure the repository is public to allow for grading and feedback.
   - Include a README file with an overview of the project, setup instructions, and any relevant information.

2. **IBM Carbon Design System Integration:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the [IBM Carbon Design System documentation](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/).
   - Use the Carbon Design System to implement the UI components in your web application.
   - Ensure your application includes a variety of elements from Carbon, such as Buttons, Forms, Navigation, Tables, and more.

3. **Functionality and Interactivity:**
   - Your application should not only be static but also include interactive elements. For example, form submissions, modal pop-ups, or dynamic tables.
   - JavaScript frameworks/libraries (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) may be used but are not mandatory. You can also use Carbon Components Vanilla JavaScript version.

4. **Accessibility and Responsiveness:**
   - Ensure your web application is accessible, following [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
   - The application should be responsive and provide a seamless experience on different devices and screen sizes.

5. **Documentation and Code Quality:**
   - Document your code adequately, providing comments and explanations for major functionalities.
   - Structure your codebase in a clean, efficient, and modular way, following best practices in web development.

#### Submission Guidelines:
- Submit the URL of your GitHub repository via Pirou's Academy submission portal.
- Include a brief report within your repository (as a separate Markdown file or part of the README) discussing:
  - Your development process and choices.
  - Challenges faced and how you overcame them.
  - Any additional features or notable aspects of your project.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Functionality:** The application works as intended without bugs.
- **Design System Implementation:** Effective use of the IBM Carbon Design System's components and guidelines.
- **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- **Accessibility and Responsiveness:** The application is accessible and provides a good user experience across devices.
- **Creativity and Innovation:** Incorporation of unique features or innovative use of technology.
