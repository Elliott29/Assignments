# Assignment for Pero's Academy: Implementing DevOps Practices for Educational Labs with Documentation

#### Overview:
This assignment requires students to not only implement a virtual lab environment using DevOps tools and practices but also to create a detailed tutorial and lab guide. This dual focus will test both their technical proficiency and their ability to communicate complex information clearly and effectively.

#### Objectives:
1. **Set up a fully automated lab environment** using modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.
2. **Document the process** thoroughly to create a comprehensive lab guide that can be used by other learners.

#### Tools and Technologies:
- **Terraform**
- **cloud-init**
- **Docker**
- **CI/CD tools** (e.g., GitHub Actions or Jenkins)

#### Assignment Details:

##### Part 1: Infrastructure and Container Setup
- **Task 1: Terraform Infrastructure** - Provision a VM with appropriate networking and security configurations.
- **Task 2: VM Customization with cloud-init** - Prepare the VM with Docker, user accounts, and necessary software.
- **Task 3: Docker Container Configuration** - Develop Dockerfiles to deploy at least three different containers.

##### Part 2: Automation with CI/CD
- **Task**: Automate the building, testing, and deployment of Docker images using CI/CD pipelines.

##### Part 3: Documentation and Tutorial Creation
- **Task 1: Documentation** - Document every step, tool, and decision made during the setup with explanations and justifications.
  - Use markdown to maintain a clear structure.
  - Include code snippets, configuration files, and CLI commands used.
  - Provide diagrams and flowcharts to visualize processes and architecture.
- **Task 2: Lab Guide/Tutorial** - Create a separate document that acts as a tutorial for future students to replicate the lab setup.
  - Include step-by-step instructions that are clear and beginner-friendly.
  - Highlight troubleshooting tips and explain common issues that may arise.
  - Incorporate screenshots and links to additional resources.

#### Submission Guidelines:
- All code and documentation should be submitted through a GitHub repository.
- The README.md file must detail the project and include links to the tutorial/lab guide.
- If applicable, include video demonstrations or a live demo link.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
**Category 1: Technical Setup and Innovation**
- Accuracy and functionality of the Terraform setup and cloud-init scripts.
- Efficiency, security, and interconnectivity of Docker configurations.
- Reliability and robustness of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Innovative solutions and optimizations implemented in the design.

**Category 2: Documentation Quality and Usability**
- Clarity, thoroughness, and technical accuracy of the documentation.
- Organization, readability, and visual presentation of the tutorial/lab guide.
- Usefulness of the tutorial for beginners, including ease of understanding and following the steps.
- Quality of additional instructional materials like diagrams, flowcharts, and videos.
