# Contribution Guidelines for Cybersecurity Threat Analysis Assignment

Thank you for contributing to the Cybersecurity Threat Analysis assignment. This document outlines the structure and guidelines for submitting your coursework and projects under the `Assignments/cybersecurity-threat-analysis-assignment/submissions/` directory.

## Directory Structure

Within the `submissions/` directory, each apprentice should create a personal folder. Your folder must contain two subdirectories: `coursework` and `projects`.

```
Assignments/cybersecurity-threat-analysis-assignment/submissions/
│
└── [YourName]/
    ├── coursework/
    │   └── [Assignment Files]
    └── projects/
        └── [Project Files]
```

### Coursework

- The `coursework/` folder is for individual assignments and related documents.
- Name each file to clearly reflect the assignment or topic.

### Projects

- The `projects/` folder is for project-related submissions.
- Organize your project files in a way that makes the project's structure clear.

## Naming Conventions

- **Folders**: Use your full name, without spaces, combining first and last names (e.g., `JohnDoe/`).
- **Files**: Use descriptive file names with hyphens separating words (e.g., `network-security-analysis.md`).
